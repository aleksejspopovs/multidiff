![Screenshot of multidiff, being used to compare three binary files](screenshot.png)

multidiff is a browser-based tool for comparing binary files.

Double-click a byte position to create a new segment starting at that position in that file. This is primarily useful for two things:

- forcing a line break to re-align some structure
- aligning structures that follow a variable-length segment across multiple files
